compile time - syntax error; incremental development of code helpful
 - only first error message reliable; generally error prior to location of message
 - bisection: chop half of code until error stops

Run-time error - soemthing went wrong that makes it go on and on or nothing at all (could be code error - loops, recursions)
 - NullPointerException; StackOverflowError
 
Logic errors - something to within the code; hard to find with error messages
 - must read through code
 - test code via components
 
Scale down problem to the smallest possible case that causes error!
Explain problem! Speak it aloud! Thank Duckies!
