HW60: A Termite is-a Turtle, a Thinker is-a Turtle
2022-02-07
Time Spent: 0.5 hrs

DISCO:
- We are a mess :D
- We are automatically to assume that everything is unsorted.

QCC:
- Is this form similar to binary sort?
- Why must we divide the card into two halves and then pass it onto two other thinkers? 
Can't we just take one and pass?
- What would be the Big O notation of this type of sort? (log?)

Thinker Firmware:
- If cards > 1, declare unsorted. 
- Divide deck into two (int). 
- Hand the two new decks to two thinkers whose hands are up.
- If thinker receives card, they should memorize the person who gave them the cards. Thus, when 
they return their cards, they know who to return it to. (Thinker's only job is to memorize the
person who gave them the card! And to sort the unsorted deck once the cards are returned to them.) 

receives deck of card --> divide in two --> give to thinker with hand up --> get back the deck of cards
--> sort them --> return to your giver
