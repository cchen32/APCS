==================
Activity 1
==================
1a. method signature: name - sentimentVal; returns a double; is static
1b. the method requires a string parameter or else there will be a compilation error.
1c. it returns a double.

2.
Method Call                     || Return Value
===============================================================
sentimentVal("hello");             0.75
sentimentVal("awesome");           0.92
sentimentVal("peers");             0.5


3a. It will compile because there is a singular String parameter given. Also,
sentimentVal() is a double, so you can set a double variable as the called
method.
3b. It will NOT compile because it inputs a double and attempts to set a String
as the called method, creating two cases of incompatible types.
3c. It will NOT compile because it inputs two String, but sentimentVal() only
accepts one String argument.

==================
Activity 2
==================

1+2: terminal returned 4.109999999999999.

4.
It iterates through the file, searching for spaces, and once that is found, totalSentiments will classify everything prior to the space as a word. and find the
sentimentVal. Then, everything from prior to the space would be removed, and the function will continue iterating through the rest, summing up all the
sentimentVals. This will continue until nothing is left and the total is returne.

5a. Not particularly because the setiments have to be really high in order to return a good rating.
5b. We can multiply totalSentiment by some factor or we can check the rating against the input word count.

6. he should reversed the comparison sign around because in his current code, no matter if the totalSentiment is 0 or 14, it will always return 4. 

==================
ACTIVITY 3
==================

3. indexOf() returns the index of a character in a String. substring() returns
part of a String, beginning from the specified start index up to the specified
end index. These methods can be used to divide a string into two parts by finding
the index of the character you want to split at and creating two separate 
substrings. The first substring will have all the characters from the first character
up until the character at the specified index. The second substring will contain
the rest of the characters of the original string.

5. The difference between calling static methods as opposed to calling non-static methods is that for static methods, it 
can be called without creating an instance of Review. On the other hand, an instance of a class has to be created to access
the non-static method.

6. fakeReview can be modified by using randomPositiveAdj() or randomNegativeAdj() to create a (strictly) fake positive review
or a (strictly) fake negative review.

==================
ACTIVITY 4
==================

1. You want to troll something you really dislike.
2. You want to support something you fervently like. 
3. Instead of a review that might be negative or positive, we can create a solely positive one as to avoid randomness.
5. Removes first index.
6. Not removing it might cause an exception where no sentimentVal is returned.
7. Yes, if every chance of negativity is removed and only positive adjectives are used.
