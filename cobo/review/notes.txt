==================
Activity 1
==================
1a. method signature: name - sentimentVal; returns a double; is static
1b. the method requires a string parameter or else there will be a compilation error.
1c. it returns a double.

2.
Method Call                     || Return Value
===============================================================
sentimentVal("hello");             0.75
sentimentVal("awesome");           0.92
sentimentVal("peers");             0.5


3a. It will compile because there is a singular String parameter given. Also,
sentimentVal() is a double, so you can set a double variable as the called
method.
3b. It will NOT compile because it inputs a double and attempts to set a String
as the called method, creating two cases of incompatible types.
3c. It will NOT compile because it inputs two String, but sentimentVal() only
accepts one String argument.

Activity 2

3. indexOf() returns the index of a character in a String. substring() returns
part of a String, beginning from the specified start index up to the specified
end index. These methods can be used to divide a string into two parts by finding
the index of the character you want to split at and creating two separate 
substrings. The first substring will have all the characters from the first character
up until the character at the specified index. The second substring will contain
the rest of the characters of the original string. Autogenerated Review
