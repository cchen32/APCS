/*Discoveries
BigSib.java has no need for a main method because it's not the one being called. Also it's meant to be "String" as in BigSib.java returns String and not "void". Also I guess
"return" is more practical than "System.out.println" as I had originally put it because that would be redundant.*/

/*Unresolved mysteries
What is static void?*/

public static Greet{
  public static void main(String[] args)
    System.out.println( BigSib.greet("Crosby") );
    System.out.println( BigSib.greet("Stills") );
    System.out.println( BigSib.greet("Nash") );
}
