/*Discoveries
BigSib.java has no need for a main method because it's not the one being called. Also it's meant to be "String" as it BigSib.java returns String and not "void". */

/*Unresolved mysteries
What is static void?*/

public static Greet{
  public static void main(String[] args)
    System.out.println( BigSib.greet("Crosby") );
    System.out.println( BigSib.greet("Stills") );
    System.out.println( BigSib.greet("Nash") );
